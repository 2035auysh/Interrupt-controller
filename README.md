The project has the Verilog code that works in two different interrupt modes, either priority mode or Polling mode. 



A renowned case study 
NASA’s Mars Pathfinder mission, where priority inversion incidents caused periodic,
system-wide resets that threatened the entire mission until a software patch implementing a solution was transmitted from Earth.

This project also contains the solution to the priority inversion by priority inheritance in Verilog.
