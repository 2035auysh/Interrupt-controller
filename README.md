The project has the Verilog code that works in two different interrupt modes, either priority mode or Polling mode in Verilog.




A renowned case study 
NASAâ€™s Mars Pathfinder mission, where priority inversion incidents caused periodic,

This project also contains the solution to the priority inversion by priority inheritance in Verilog.
